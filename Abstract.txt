The Project is developed with keeping in mind to make the process more smooth as compared 
with the physical one. The process where people are supposed to go the office of E-Desk & 
lodge a complaint in the respective Department. There were many incidents which makes it clear that there 
is no proper communication between the government and public & there is also a lack of efficient way to 
solve the public problems. The problems of public gets enrolled in the files and travels from desk to desk, 
office to office.
Our web application is a way to overcome this problem by providing grievances to the government. It 
will reduce the dependency of people on the government officials to forward their complains & they will be 
able to keep track of the status of their complaints. It will also help the officials to look into the matter in the 
brief period of time. It acts as interface to register oneâ€™s complained and follow it up and also it provides a 
complaint module which helps entering text information along with the complaint.
The scope of this project is focused on designing & implementing a web based system for online user complaints 
by using innovative technologies such as Springboot, MySQL & ReactJS
